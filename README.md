This repository will contain my practice tech tests as well as notes/learnings regarding them.

rest_api_tech_test:

&emsp;1 - Read the requirements and ask for clarification if in doubt!

&emsp;2 - How to send curl command prompts through JavaScript although still streuggling to send data. Will look into more later (wasn't required for test)

&emsp;3 - In-Memory databases use RAM over SSD which makes them quicker however run the risk of data loss if server loses power for example and are more expensive to run due to RAM requirements.

&emsp;4 - NoSQL databases are non-relational databases and look similar to JSON files. Data is all stored together in objects (and objects within objects) so do not require multiple tables or links between data.

&emsp;5 - How to better use the Jest testing library and in particular how to write tests that create connections to external databases, specifically Mongodb.
